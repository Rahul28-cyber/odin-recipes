                <h3>Malaiyo</h3>
                <p>Malaiyo, also known as Nimish or Daulat ki Chaat, is a delicate, frothy dessert that hails from the streets of Varanasi, India. Made by churning milk for hours and allowing it to absorb the morning dew on cold winter nights, Malaiyo is a seasonal delight available only during the winter months. The milk foam is gently flavored with saffron, cardamom, and sometimes garnished with slivers of almonds and pistachios, creating a cloud-like texture that melts in the mouth. It is light, airy, and subtly sweet — a perfect balance of flavor and elegance.</p>
